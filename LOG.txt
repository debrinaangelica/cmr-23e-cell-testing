test_cell_rest_4_15amp
    - running our first actual test

testdata_#.csv  
    - data files from testing with power supply

test_cell_0
test_cell_1
test_cell_2
    - data from testing with actual cell (for some reason kept erring)

test_cell_3
    - data from testing actual cell, load doesn't act weird now
    - maybe because using different terminals?

test_cell_rest_0
    - 0.5A 1 second, 15A 10 seconds, 100 second rest  
    - ends when cell is below 2.4V
