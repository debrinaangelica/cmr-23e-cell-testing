~ 5 pulses for DCIR measurement (put this in its own csv file)

after the 5 pulses is up, discharge the cell at constant 15 A current until voltage reaches 28.V to be safe.

for both: track voltage current data 
for DCIR: calculate data 

possibility:
    whenever we receive a packet with less than 26 bytes, we can log it in a log file to say for how many data points 
    we're missing out on.
    LOG file could record the time interval during which data failed to be measured.
    make sure this error doesn't happen for a lot of seconds at a time.
